HUMAN TESTS:

1. Login (1)
2. Signup (1 - set up database on server)
3. Signup with the same username/email should not be allowed,
   and such a request should not change the current SQL database 
3. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-means (See 10)
	-Variation with different values of epsilon/hyperparameterts
	-File with -1
			   -2
			   >2 dimensional input data
4. Mean with all the 4 mechanisms, no NaN
	-Laplace (1)
	-Bounded Laplace (1)
	-Staircase (1)
	-Gaussian (1)
5. Median, no NaN (0, See 10)
6. With nan values in input file: (0)
	-Mean
	-Median
	-DPML (all three mechs)
   throw an error from backend to front-end
7. With wrong file format in DPML
	- an error message explaining the correct format
8. Uploading a file with existing name does not delete the existing file (0)
9. Check good errors when:
	- high<low (1)
	-File Size bigg (1)
	-File format wrong (1)
	-Datafile is empty
	-e=0, d=0 not allowed (1)
10. Qualitative Variation
	-DP Visualisation
		-Mean
			-Laplace
				1. Accuracy increase with epsilon: close to true mean at large epsilon (1)
				2. Values of High/Low, in and out of the range; High = Low (1)
			-Bounded Laplace
				1. Accuracy increase with epsilon: close to true mean at large epsilon (1)
				2. Accuracy increase with delta: close to true mean at large delta (1)
				3. Values of High/Low, in and out of the range; High = Low (1)
			-Staircase
				1. Accuracy increase with epsilon: close to true mean at large epsilon (1)
				2. ??@Vaik: Variation with gamma??
				3. Values of High/Low, in and out of the range; High = Low (1)
			-Gaussian
				1. Values of High/Low, in and out of the range; High = Low (1)
				2. High range High/Low gives wider graph (1)
				3. Accuracy increase with epsilon: close to true mean at large epsilon (1)
				4. Accuracy increase with delta: close to true mean at large delta (1)
		-Median
			1. Accuracy increase with epsilon: close to true mean at large epsilon (0)
			2. Values of High/Low, in and out of the range; High = Low (0)
			3. High range High/Low gives wider graph (0)
	-DPML
		-Logistic Regression
			1. Train accuracy increase with epochs (1)
			2. Test accuracy: under- and over- fitting with epochs for low enough lambda (0?-> @Lay check sklearn logistic regression, max_iter, early stop?)
			3. Train accuracy decrease with lambda (1)
			4. Train accuracy decrease with split ratio (1?-only a liitle for adult dataset)
		-Naive Bayes
			1. Accuracy increase with epsilon (1)
			2. Train accuracy decrease with lambda
